## Author message

This program is just a simple implementation made to simplify and speed up my work. Some IDEs have plugins for this but I couldn't find any that fit my requirements: `just something simple, small & quick`.

Even Though it's still improvable, I may not change or update this repo in a while (Only if I need it).
